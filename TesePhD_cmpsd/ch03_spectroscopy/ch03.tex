\chapter{Overview of Spectroscopy}

 In its pure form it has the following definition:
\begin{align}
G(x;\mu,\sigma) = \dfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2 \pi}}\exp{\left(-\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right )}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the expected value, the central wavelength, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. The FWHM can be expressed explicitly in terms of the curve's standard deviation:
\begin{align}
FWHM =  2 \sqrt{2 \ln (2) } \sigma
\end{align}

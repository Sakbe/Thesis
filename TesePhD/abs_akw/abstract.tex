\chapter*{Abstract}
Active feedback magnetic control for fusion plasmas is one of the main engineering tasks to be solved in magnetically  confined devices like tokamaks. One of the main objectives when using magnetic control in a tokamak is to control the plasma position and shape. This is done by means of the Poloidal Field (PF) coils and through the diagnostics which reconstruct the plasma position and last closed flux surface (LCFS).
\smallskip

This thesis presents an overall overview of control systems used in tokamaks along with a the asssments and upgrade done in two tokamaks: JT60-SA (Japan) and ISTTOK (Portugal).

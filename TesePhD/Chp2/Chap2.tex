\chapter{Plasma Control Systems}

\section{Overview of control systems}
The control of  plasma position, shape and current among other parameters is one of the crucial engineering problems for present and future tokamaks. The Plasma Control Systems (PCS) lead with the overall control of the fusion devices  being responsible also for the  plasma configuration and scenarios algorithms \cite[Chapter~8]{PCS_2018}.
